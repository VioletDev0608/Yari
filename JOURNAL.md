## 10/24/2025 - Ergogen Basics  

First journal!!
Thank you all at hack club for hosting such thing as blueprint for teens to get a chance to build what they always dreamed of.

I read through the ergogen documentation, trying to follow step by step what they were doing and watched Ben Vallack's tutorial on how to operate it.
Watched the presentation by the creator of ergogen to get a grasp on what the software was originally made for doing. After that, since I had thought I wanted to make an ergonomic keyboard that felt like a laptop so I did some research if I could hand solder those switches. I saw some users on reddit saying it would be quite difficult without an oven so I decided to compromise and use normal choc low profile switches for this build. Played around with the Absolem template because it was the simplest one I could find that used a lot of ergogen's features. 

I was able to understand the basics of ergogen in this session.

## 10/28/2025 - Completed Key Layout  

Followed flatfootfox's tutorial on how to get about designing what you want. It was one of the most intuitive and easily understandable tutorials I've followed.
I knew what I kind of wanted design wise:
	**PCB**:
		USB-C compatible
		36 keys
		3 key thumb cluster
		Low profile(choc spaced)
		Reversible PCB for lower cost
		Columns staggered
		Ortholinear
		Wireless
		(Diode-less) Optional but preferred for ease of building and cheaper costs
		Angled pinky and ring finger columns
	**Case**:
		An option to go caseless
		Magsafe tenting compatibility
		(Tenting puck compatibility) Probably wont work on it unless magsafe ends up not working	
The idea of having a keyboard custom tailored to my hands always seemed appealing to me. So I adjusted the stagger and drew it on a paper to see how it would feel to type on it.(My notebook was a 6mm grid so it worked flawlessly for this project). Had some trouble understanding how the splay thing worked but asked some nice fellas in the Absolem Discord server simplified it for me so it was easier for me to understand. 
For future reference:
	`spread`: horizontal padding
	`splay`: rotation
	`stagger`: vertical movement
	`origin` controls: the point where to start
Excited since it's starting to take properly take shape!!!
