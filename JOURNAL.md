## 10/24/2025 - Ergogen Basics  

First journal!!
Thank you all at hack club for hosting such thing as blueprint for teens to get a chance to build what they always dreamed of.

I read through the ergogen documentation, trying to follow step by step what they were doing and watched Ben Vallack's tutorial on how to operate it.
Watched the presentation by the creator of ergogen to get a grasp on what the software was originally made for doing. After that, since I had thought I wanted to make an ergonomic keyboard that felt like a laptop so I did some research if I could hand solder those switches. I saw some users on reddit saying it would be quite difficult without an oven so I decided to compromise and use normal choc low profile switches for this build. Played around with the Absolem template because it was the simplest one I could find that used a lot of ergogen's features. 

I was able to understand the basics of ergogen in this session.
