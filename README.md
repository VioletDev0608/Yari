# Yari
Yari is a 38 key columns-staggered choc split keyboard. It is designed to reduce the required thumb movement beneath the palm.
It has 2 LEDS to indicate battery levels, splayed pinky and row columns, and is meant to be used with a Supermini nRF52840 microcontroller.

## Features:
- 36 Keys
- Column staggered
- Choc v1
- Splayed pinky and row columns
- 2 LEDS for battery indication
- ZMK support
- Wireless

## CAD Model:

The assembly itself is quite simple
Use a soldering iron to heat up the threaded screw inserts and help it melt its way into the slightly undersized standoff holes. Secure the PCB using the M2 screws. 

## PCB

Most of the PCB was created using ergogen so I don't have a silkscreen to show!
There are quotes scattered around the PCB so make sure to enjoy them.

## Firmware

Firmware is based on ZMK!
Hasn't been tested yet...
