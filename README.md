# Yari
Yari is a 36-key column-staggered choc split keyboard. It is designed to reduce the required thumb movement beneath the palm.
It has 1 LED to indicate battery levels, splayed pinky and row columns, and is meant to be used with two Supermini nRF52840 microcontrollers. It features an EC11 rotary encoder and extra key on the left half that can be used to switch layers, etc.

## Features:
- 37 Keys
- Column staggered
- Choc v1
- Splayed pinky and row columns
- 1 LED for battery indication
- ZMK support
- Wireless
- EC11 Rotary Encoder

## CAD Model:

The case is a open style with no walls surrounding the switches and just a simple tray to mount the keyboard to and prevent dust from getting into the assembly.
The assembly itself is quite simple
Use a soldering iron to heat up the threaded screw inserts and help it melt its way into the slightly undersized standoff holes. Secure the PCB using the M2 screws.

## PCB

PCB was made entirely in Kicad and rotated to minimize the costs when fabricating the PCB. 
There are some quotes on the palm so check it out!

## BOM

Check [BOM.csv](https://github.com/VioletDev0608/Yari/blob/main/BOM/BOM%20-%20Yari.csv) for all parts needed to build this keyboard!
It comes out to about 98 dollars using aliexpress and JLCPCB to fabricate the PCB!
